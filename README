filter
======
Filter stdin using grep.

Installation
------------
I recommend installing filter in the /usr/local/bin directory using the
following command:

    cp filter /usr/local/bin

Usage
-----
filter is really just a wrapper around grep with the flags:
- h: Suppress the prefixing of filenames on output.
- v: Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.

It is used just like you would use grep. You can also include other grep flags,
which will override the built-in grep flags of filter, such as:
- H: Print the filename for each match.

Dependencies
------------
- grep
